The current program supports characters A-Z, 0-9, and a few special characters (check chars.dat for a complete listing). You can add new characters 
and numbers as well. To do so, create the art in the abc.txt file with your favorite text editor and save it. The art must be of 8 lines tall, 
nothing more, nothing less. See the example of the letter "L" below or the colon (":") character in the abc.txt file.

After adding the art, run the StarCount program located in the "src" directory. The program will output some code in the terminal that will provide 
the WordToArt program some instructions for printing the art. Next, open the file chars.dat and write the character that you are adding with a 
hyphen next to it (in the case of the letter "L", L-<YOUR GENERATED CODE HERE>). Next time you run WordToArt, you will be able to print the art of 
the letter.

While adding art, its important that all the characters have same number of characters and spaces in each line otherwise the ASCII design will fail.
Be especially carefule with the spaces at the end of the line. We have represted spaces here with 0. So for the letter L, the art must be:

*00000000
*00000000
*00000000
*00000000
*00000000
*00000000
*00000000
